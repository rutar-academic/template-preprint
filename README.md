# Preprint Template
## Instructions
This is a template for use with [copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
If you want to use this template yourself, you first need to install copier (e.g. `pip install copier`), create a new directory, change into it, and then then run
```sh
copier gh:rutar-academic/template-preprint .
```
If this template has updated and you also want to update your local template, from the root of the project folder, run
```sh
copier update
```
